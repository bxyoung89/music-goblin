## Important note on copyright

Don't host things you don't own or don't fall under fair use. That being said, the authors of this repo aren't hosting the files and aren't legally liable for anything you do with it.

## Getting started

Making a new website is easy but first you'll need to get a couple of things

* A [github](https://github.com/) account
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
* [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/)

You'll also want to have the songs you want to use as well.

Basic steps are going to be:
* fork the repo
* replace content with your stuff
* run `npm run build` in the console
* follow the steps on https://pages.github.com/ to host it

If you want to add more songs, just modify content and run `npm run build` again.
